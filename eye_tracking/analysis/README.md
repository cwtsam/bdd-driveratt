Surface detector:

 We've created a new implementation of the April tags package. The main maker detector is in manual_detection.py, that runs using the april_tags package: https://github.com/pupil-labs/apriltags

 To install: pip install pupil-apriltags

This code has been built and modified using Pycharm. Please note that you'll need to add the eye_tracking/analysis/lib/pupil/pupil_src as source root for the paths to work. 
Otherwise you may need to add the paths in another way.
